I wake up, eat breakfast, check which hololive girls are streaming and most of time you're streaming. Although my japanese isn't that great, which means I can't understand you most of the time, I really like your streams. You can just be doing whatever, talking about anything and still make it entertaining. You've worked hard and deserve the milestone of 1 million subscribers for sure! I'll look forward to seeing your parents' reaction to you being a V-tuber and I'll keep watching your stream whenever I can.１００万おめでとう！！！！！！！！！！",

Hopefully with your amazing Pekolish you can read and understand what I want to say in this message (if not, that's okay though!). \nFirstly: Congratulations!!! You've made 900,000 people happy with your hard work, and probably many more who just watch your clips! \n\nSecondly, I want to tell you how you captured my heart. I had known about you and subscribed to your channel a long time ago, because I thought you were a funny bunny. Which you very much are, but I like you because of more than just that. When I found your cover of Discommunication Alien, I loved the song and your voice, but I didn't know what it meant. I just knew it sounded good. But I read a comment while scrolling, and it said you had a social anxiety problem. I thought, \"No way, she sounds so outgoing and extroverted!\" But then I read the lyrics of the song I was listening to, and understood. I also found out you said you don't like to be on the Hololive JP server when there are many others on it, and it made a lot of sense. I thought it was amazing that you who has anxiety problems can be so active, so funny, and so entertaining to so many people! The way you carry yourself on streams was and is inspiring to me; it made me fall in love with you and your strength. \n\nI cannot thank you enough for simply being you, and it's all I can do to give you my support through methods like this, so if you would, please take it, it would mean the world to me. \n\nLove,\nJust Another Nousagi.\n\n私は本当に本当にあなたが好きです。",

You have been the craziest rabbit with full of energy, making everyone happy and uplift the moods of other idols in the collabs. Thank you Peko and have fun doing what you love for the viewers!",

Pekora was the vtuber who i had first experienced through a recommended youtube clip of pekora dropping the netherite sword in lava and from then on i've always looked forward to the nightime when pekora delivers the daily stream because of (Commedian) Sasuga usagi and her combo laugh. However, 1 million nousagi is not the end so i am very eager to accompany the channel to the future! congratulations again peko~~",

I feel blessed and proud for one of my favourite vtubers to hit the 1 million milestone in this year, words may not express how I feel now, but I'll try my best to do so. 2020 may have been a hell of a year, but it is you who have bought me, blessed me and entertained me from the void of emptiness, I don't feel that much of a pathetic loser anymore, thanks to you. I remember when I first watched one of your streams, it was at the first 2 months of 2020. Your channel may not be as big as it is now, but what has caught my attention is not about the subscriber count nor the likes, it's your laughter, your cute, pure, joyful, laughter. The laughter of yours is like a work of art, everyday I listen to your laughter I feel more blessed, feels like I'm on cloud nine. It has been a long way since you started your career at Holo-live, honestly it has also been a fun ride, I hope the cute rabbit that I love so much will do even better and better. I would like to congratulate you on hitting the 1 million milestone, it is such a wonderful accomplishment, honestly. ",

I've actually enjoy more of your talking streams (i.e. Snack Usada) and singing streams! Not that I dislike your gaming streams, they're always fun to watch! Hoping for more fun and engaging streams in the future! Waddle on!\n\nThanks for entertaining us in this dire time, we really thank you for that too!",

Thank you for giving us love and joy so I hope this message will give love and joy to our dear うさぎ as well. Pekora totally deserves this milestone, no doubt. Pekora, I am excited to see what you can do in the future, I am sure it'll be a blast. I wish for your health and happiness, I am not good with words so I cannot really express my feelings to its fullest but I really cannot thank you enough for making me smile, I hope I do the same to you with this message. Let's keep reaching for greater heights! レッツゴーぺこら！がんばぺこ！Also, the fanart I made was drawn in MS Paint and I don't have a drawing tablet so I used my mouse instead, I don't really draw anyways so it's totally fine, I hope you get a good laugh out of that fanart! は↗は↘は↗は↘は↗ ღゝ◡╹)ノ♡",
