2020/11/12 18:39:44,,,,,,"Hello Pekora! Hopefully with your amazing Pekolish you can read and understand what I want to say in this message (if not, that's okay though!). 
Firstly: Congratulations!!! You've made 900,000 people happy with your hard work, and probably many more who just watch your clips! 

Secondly, I want to tell you how you captured my heart. I had known about you and subscribed to your channel a long time ago, because I thought you were a funny bunny. Which you very much are, but I like you because of more than just that. When I found your cover of Discommunication Alien, I loved the song and your voice, but I didn't know what it meant. I just knew it sounded good. But I read a comment while scrolling, and it said you had a social anxiety problem. I thought, ""No way, she sounds so outgoing and extroverted!"" But then I read the lyrics of the song I was listening to, and understood. I also found out you said you don't like to be on the Hololive JP server when there are many others on it, and it made a lot of sense. I thought it was amazing that you who has anxiety problems can be so active, so funny, and so entertaining to so many people! The way you carry yourself on streams was and is inspiring to me; it made me fall in love with you and your strength.

I remember when I first watched one of your streams, it was at the first 2 months of 2020. Your channel may not be as big as it is now, but what has caught my attention is not about the subscriber count nor the likes, it's your laughter, your cute, pure, joyful, laughter.

for supporting this channel and helping it grow I-I love you guys, you guys are just awesome.
so as you can probably tell this isnt really a montage parody, this is really more like a kind thank you / update video
so in this video im quickly gonna go over two things: firstly advertisements, and more importantly : the future of this channel
and what kind of direction its headed.
okay so firstly, the advertisements. believe it or not but montage parodies are actually a copy right minefield
new content is getting claimed every day. we could use something from.. lets say.. 5 years ago, and tomorrow a huge company could come along",,,

ぺこちゃんと出会ってからまだ短い期間だけど
日々の配信を見ることで毎日頑張る気力になってるぺこだよ！🥰

これからの活動の中でどんな楽しいことや新しく挑戦することが増えていくか
まだまだ分からないことだらけだけど、ぺこーらならきっと
一つ一つ乗り越えていけるぺこだから今後も頑張ってね！😉✨

それと、またいつかどこかでホロライブの皆とライブできるのを
心の底から祈るとともに凄く楽しみにしているぺこな～！

Before I knew Hololive, or actually before I even knew what VTubers are, I watched a random clip with you, and I instantly knew you're going to achieve amazing things. Now, almost 10 months later since I first discovered you, I have no doubt it my mind that 1 million is just a first step on your way toward inevitable world domination. Your sense of humor, your personality, your perseverance, and the way you interact with your viewers - I love it all! Thank you for being with us!",,,
