2020/11/12 18:39:44,,,,,,"Hello Pekora! Hopefully with your amazing Pekolish you can read and understand what I want to say in this message (if not, that's okay though!). 
Firstly: Congratulations!!! You've made 900,000 people happy with your hard work, and probably many more who just watch your clips! 

Secondly, I want to tell you how you captured my heart. I had known about you and subscribed to your channel a long time ago, because I thought you were a funny bunny. Which you very much are, but I like you because of more than just that. When I found your cover of Discommunication Alien, I loved the song and your voice, but I didn't know what it meant. I just knew it sounded good. But I read a comment while scrolling, and it said you had a social anxiety problem. I thought, ""No way, she sounds so outgoing and extroverted!"" But then I read the lyrics of the song I was listening to, and understood. I also found out you said you don't like to be on the Hololive JP server when there are many others on it, and it made a lot of sense. I thought it was amazing that you who has anxiety problems can be so active, so funny, and so entertaining to so many people! The way you carry yourself on streams was and is inspiring to me; it made me fall in love with you and your strength. 

I cannot thank you enough for simply being you, and it's all I can do to give you my support through methods like this, so if you would, please take it, it would mean the world to me. 

Love,
Just Another Nousagi.

Pekora was the vtuber who i had first experienced through a recommended youtube clip of pekora dropping the netherite sword in lava and from then on i've always looked forward to the nightime when pekora delivers the daily stream because of (Commedian) Sasuga usagi and her combo laugh. However, 1 million nousagi is not the end so i am very eager to accompany the channel to the future! congratulations again peko~~"

I feel blessed and proud for one of my favourite vtubers to hit the 1 million milestone in this year, words may not express how I feel now, but I'll try my best to do so. 2020 may have been a hell of a year, but it is you who have bought me, blessed me and entertained me from the void of emptiness, I don't feel that much of a pathetic loser anymore, thanks to you. I remember when I first watched one of your streams, it was at the first 2 months of 2020. Your channel may not be as big as it is now, but what has caught my attention is not about the subscriber count nor the likes, it's your laughter, your cute, pure, joyful, laughter. The laughter of yours is like a work of art, everyday I listen to your laughter I feel more blessed, feels like I'm on cloud nine. It has been a long way since you started your career at Holo-live, honestly it has also been a fun ride, I hope the cute rabbit that I love so much will do even better and better.

 I knew you would reach 1 million, and I told them all you would be the face of vtubing worldwide and I believe it to be so. Things may have been rough recently and may be so in the future but remember that you are worthy of being the best and are loved just as much. Thanks for inspiring me and the Nousagi, you inspired me to want to become a vtuber. Your talent never ceases to show something new. It’s a joy for us all just to watch you have fun and grow. Please never stop. I knew from the first moment I saw your clips you were a real talent, and it didn’t take me long to figure out you could be the best.

so as you can probably tell this isnt really a montage parody, this is really more like a kind thank you / update video
so in this video im quickly gonna go over two things: firstly advertisements, and more importantly : the future of this channel
and what kind of direction its headed.
okay so firstly, the advertisements. believe it or not but montage parodies are actually a copy right minefield
new content is getting claimed every day. we could use something from.. lets say.. 5 years ago, and tomorrow a huge company could come along"

I've been a fan of you since 390K subscribers, let's say... you've come a long journey, a really, REALLY fun and engaging long journey if I do say so! I've actually enjoy more of your talking streams (i.e. Snack Usada) and singing streams! Not that I dislike your gaming streams, they're always fun to watch! Hoping for more fun and engaging streams in the future! Waddle on!

Congrats on 1M subs! When you come out to your mom, show her the Pekora plum wine and other Pekora goods to give her an idea of how much of a big shot you are!

Watching your stream has brought me joy every day. You're not just a cute idol and mischievous comedian; you've earned my respect and admiration with your earnest attitude toward your VTuber role, hard work off-stream, and refusal to give up on-stream. I look forward to Hololive 2nd fes and the next chapter of Pekora Story!

I was the American Nousagi who asked Pekora-mama for love advice during Snack Usada a few months ago. To the cute and funny bunny girl living faraway who's much older than me: I love you. I love you! I love you!!
